Level 1

At this level you will introduce yourself to the fundamental concepts of generics. You will learn how to create classes and methods that work with any type of data, and you will see how Java manages flexible but secure typing.
Exercise 1 — Class without generics

Create a class called NoGenericMethodsthat stores three arguments of the same type, along with:

    a builder to initialize them,
    and methods getElement1(), getElement2(), getElement3()to access it.

Check that you can pass the arguments in any order to the constructor.

This exercise is used to later compare behavior with a generic version.
